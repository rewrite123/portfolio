# The future of AI driven development

Since the introduction of ChatGPT, and the continuous improvement through ChatGPT-3 and the new ChatGPT-4, the entire world of software development has been drastically shaken up. The skill cieling and barrier to entry in this field has dropped significantly. In the coming years we can expect competition to rise sharply as you no longer need to be an expert to build complicated systems like payment service processors or build a CMS from scratch. Roles are shifting more and more away from developers and more towards AI directors to generate prompts for coding solutions and to glue code outputs from prompts together into a single coherent piece of software. I want to take a moment and discuss how I am going to stay competetive in this new world of AI and lay out a general strategy for how I think developers should move forward generally.

## Sink or swim - new waves of technology are coming and treading water by trying to just be the best code writer you can be isn't enough to survive the rough seas ahead.

As developers new you already know that new technologies and services ensure that the coding landscape is always changing. For many, not staying up to date with the current standards and practices is akin to drowning. I can extend this analogy by comparing the this landscape to the ocean. Developers can stay afloat by learning the occasional new tech and mastering the ones they already have - treading water. You can swim freely by adopting technologies frequently and improving your workflow. Then you can sail through the ocean waves by not only doing that, but also implementing and contributing new software that will be a part of the next ocean wave of technologies.

Continuing with this analogy, there is a sunami, a large wave that threatens many of those who are just treading water or even just casually swimming. This is of course AI like ChatGPT. Unlike many of the waves before it, this one will forever change how we swim - how we create software.

The core part of our jobs as software developers is our ability to think in terms of software and implement those thoughts as code. AI has now shown us that this ability is no longer so unique to us. Models trained on software written in the past have gotten to the point that they can write usable software from basic ideas laid out in a prompt. Developers will no longer be needed to write 100% of the software for a business or client as they can simply write out a request and have an entire view or feature complete in a matter of minutes.

As depressing as this may be to someone like me or you who has spent their entire life specializing and enjoying all the profitable weirdness and prestige of software, there is still room for you. I have been tinkering with ChatGPT for awhile now. I was aware of it even in 2021 when it was not making all the news headlines. I even use it professionally in my work to speed up my development time. And although it has been great, it still requires some skill to use effectivly.

## Write good prompts

First, get good at writing prompts. Although you can type any form of prompt into ChatGPT, the way you write out the prompt matters a lot. Your boss or client can type and speak in plain english, but it's useless if they don't know the coding terminology behind it for ChatGPT to understand for writing software. Take advantage of this by pitching yourself and an AI prompt specialist. You convert normalspeak into usable prompts for the AI to understand.

Then there is the general prompt styling. If it is too general you will get different coding styles and even incorrect solutions. If you don't format it right or include subtext about the intended environment it may make incorrect assumptions about your software and therefore generate code that does not work. Start viewing yourself not as a developer, but as an AI director that guides the AI to the correct solution. I think that our titles as developers might even change to something more like AI director or even AI prompt specialist.

Here is what ChatGPT thinks is the best way to write prompts for reference:

> 1. Be clear and specific: The more specific you can be in your prompt, the more likely it is that ChatGPT will be able to generate a useful response. Avoid vague or open-ended prompts, as these can result in less relevant or coherent responses.
>
> 2. Provide context: Giving ChatGPT some context for your prompt can help it understand what you're looking for and generate a more relevant response. This might include information about your topic or question, as well as any relevant background information or examples.
>
> 3. Use natural language: Try to phrase your prompts in a natural and conversational way, as if you were asking a friend or colleague. Avoid overly technical or formal language, as this can be more difficult for ChatGPT to understand.
>
> 4. Ask open-ended questions: Rather than asking simple yes/no questions, try to ask open-ended questions that invite ChatGPT to provide more detailed or nuanced responses. This can help you get more interesting and informative answers.
>
> 5. Experiment with different prompts: ChatGPT is a powerful tool, but it's not perfect. Sometimes you may need to try several different prompts before finding one that generates the response you're looking for. Don't be afraid to experiment and refine your prompts over time.
>
> 6. Keep it brief: While you want to provide enough context for ChatGPT to understand your prompt, you also don't want to overload it with too much information. Try to keep your prompts brief and to the point.
>
> 7. Stay on topic: ChatGPT works best when you keep your prompts focused on a specific topic or question. Avoid jumping around between different topics or asking multiple questions in a single prompt, as this can confuse ChatGPT and result in less useful responses.

## Gluing prompt coding outputs together

Don't give up on coding! You still need it! Although AI can generate the code, you can't expect to give it 100% of the context at all times and get a drop-in solution that you can copy and paste into your codebase. Often times you need to write or alter a little bit of code to be able to use the generated response properly. This can range from setting up a router for a view to getting a cookie from a request for the required information to verify a user. It can't always have 100% of the knowledge of the codebase, so it needs some fine detail work often to get it to work. That is where you come in and use your knowledge. See, all that hard work learning to code wasnt for nothing. Coding isn't dead afterall - just on life support XD .

## Future remarks

I think in the next two years all businesses will be using AI generated code and developers will have to cope with the lessened pay and higher throughput, but you can still thrive. I am already using this process to do more for my clients with less work. Sure I don't always get what I would have normally if I has written 100% of the website or server code myself, but my turnaround is much faster.

Don't be a luddite and sleep on AI generated coding workflows. Learn, adapt, and overcome so that you can continue providing for you and your family and advance your career.
