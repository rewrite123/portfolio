## A little about the site

This site was created entirely with React in order to show off my portfolio and skills as a developer. Sure, I could have just used Wordpress, but that would be no fun at all.

I used MaterialUI for as much as I could. It looks great and provides a lot of components with their own state management making my life easier. I also used `react-markdown` for rendering out this blog from markdown files. That way I am not writing a whole react page just to show off one simple little article. It even allows me to overwrite the html elements with MaterialUI components which makes everything look coherent.

If you are looking for a developer with awesome skills in React or Express then look no further. I got plenty of experience developing professional APIs and React SPAs and applets over the years. Take a look at my portfolio. I don't include every little contract job I have done, but all of the big ones are there.

## Can I see the source code for this website? [Sure!](https://github.com/rewrite123/portfolio/)

The source code is all available on my GitHub. Just look for the portfolio project.

## A note on Upwork

If you are looking at my Upwork account and wondering why I have so few contracts listed, it's because I try and get off of that platform soon after making contact since they steal 20% of my money. I don't mind staying on Upwork if that is what you really want, but I will be charging you an extra $10/hour to make up for the lost revenue I incur from their crummy business practices.

## Why can't I see your work on GitHub?

You may be suprised to find out that nearly all of my clients prefer not to share their source code with the world. For that reason, you won't find my professional work on my GitHub; just the occasional side-project or hobby. Many of my clients don't even use GitHub. Opting instead for BitBucket which integrates with the Jira ticketing system and burndown charts for projects.

## How do I hire you?

The best way to get my attention is to email me or take a look at my resume for more ways to contact me. I also have a contact page that lists my social media that are acceptable to message me about work opportunities.

Most of my clients already have contracts drafted prior to meeting me, but if you don't have one I can provide you with a contract document that we can edit to meet your needs.

I typically use Direct Deposit, but we can work out different payment methods if that is not something you are set up for. Do not offer me stock in your company. I do not want your stock under any circumstances unless you are already a Fortune 500 company. I can't eat or pay bills with a stock or private equity in a company. It is useless to me.

## What is your hourly rate?

### $50/hour depending on the type of work

I am open to discussing my hourly rate. Make me an offer via email and I will respond as soon as I can.

## I need someone who knows X technology. Do you have experience?

I try and list as many of the technologies I am familiar with [here](/about) and on my [resume](/Resume.pdf), but obviously there are many that I just can't fit. Please, ask me if I have experience on a particular technology or subject. You might be suprised. If not, I am always open to learning. In this industry if you are not learning a new technology every year you are drowning - and I am very good at treading water.

## Can you create a design file for my project?

Yes I can. While my design skills might not be the best, they are still good enough for most projects. I can even be your graphic designer if needed. These are both roles I have fulfilled in the past with moderate success.

I use Figma which is a free tool that allows me to quickly create designs and svgs to fit project needs. The Logo on this site for example, [the red phoenix wings](/2ffef0cc894fdc1cd745.svg), is my own creation I made with Figma.
